# CMPS 130: HW2

### Problem 1 (0.5 points) 
Prove that all regular languages are CFLs.

### Problem 2 (2 points)
Prove that the language L = {x | x is not of the form ww, w ∈ {0, 1}∗}
is a CFL. 

### Problem 3 (1.25 points)
Consider the following extension to Turing Machines. The transition function is 
of the form δ(q, σ, D) = (q', σ', D') where D is the direction the head moved 
the last time it visited this cell. (If it never visited this cell before, then 
D defaults to LEFT.) Does this provide additional power to the Turing Machine? 
Why or why not?


### Problem 4 (1.25 points) 
Consider a Turing Machine with a 2-dimensional tape. The head now has 4 possible
moves, up, down, left, or right. (Everything else is analogous to a standard 
Turing Machine.) Prove that a Turing Machine with a 2-dimensional tape can be 
simulated by a standard Turing Machine.
